# SRB2 MD3 exporter for Blender 2.8 and up
Original addon is from https://forums.duke4.net/topic/5358-blender-27-md3-export-script.

An addon that allows Blender to export a .md3 file. This "fork" adds the ability to export frame markers as animation names. This makes the exported .md3 compatible with Sonic Robo Blast 2's SPR2 animation system.
On export, can automatically rotate counter-clockwise 90 degrees, mirror across the post-rotation X-axis, and triangulate.

Works for all versions of Blender; from 2.8 up to, and including 4.0

Update to add animation names by Emerald9D
